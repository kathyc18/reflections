WHen would you want to create a remote respoitory rather than keeping all your work local?
You need a remote repository when you want to share your work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone else makes a change to the remote repository that conflicts with work you are 
doing locally and it automatically updates it would overwrite your changes at arbitrary
times.  You could do the same to them.  Even if neither has a conflict the auto pull would overwrite 
any changes you made.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?
forks only happen in GitHub to copy a repository in GitHub
clones copy repository either locally or from GitHub to local
branches are within a repository on Git and GitHub


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can do work off-line in Git against the latest official repository

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Use another source code control system, but couldn't do a pull request before commit

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes in a separate branch let's you experiment in a safe environment (local).
This is especially important on projects where you are collborating with others.  
In general, the master should represent the current working version and the separate 
branch strategy enables that.
