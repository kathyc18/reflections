WHen would you want to create a remote respoitory rather than keeping all your work local?
You need a remote repository when you want to share your work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
If someone else makes a change to the remote repository that conflicts with work you are 
doing locally and it automatically updates it would overwrite your changes at arbitrary
times.  You could do the same to them.  Even if neither has a conflict the auto pull would overwrite 
any changes you made.
