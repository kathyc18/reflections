It was critical to be able to see what changes between the working version and the new version that wasn't working.  
It is very easy to make a typo ... especially in interprester languages where no compiler is going to catch them for you.


Having easy access to the history of the file allows you to see changes over a
 long period of time.

I like having the control to group changes.  
Also allows for reasonable description of change.

Git saves all at once is good if files are relaly related - as they a=often are in code.  Google docs is much 
broader type of usage and who knows how  the files might be related (or not)

Use git log to find the commits to compare and then use git diff.  
They are in reviewse order (newest on top)

You can feel more confident making changes that could break something becuase
you know you can revert back at any time
