When you initialize a respository it creates a .git directory in the directory with the other files.  
The .git directory is used to track the status and changes to the repository.

When I did git status ... It did not say "Initial commit" but rather "No commits yet"

Staging area is used to contain the files you want to commit.  Typically you add one 
at a time to keep the changes small and logically connected.
