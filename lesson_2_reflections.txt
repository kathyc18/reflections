When you initialize a respository it creates a .git directory in the directory with the other files.  
The .git directory is used to track the status and changes to the repository.

When I did git status ... It did not say "Initial commit" but rather "No commits yet"

Staging area is used to contain the files you want to commit.  Typically you add one 
at a time to keep the changes small and logically connected.

You can use the staging area to make sure you have one commit by doing 
$git diff --staged 
which compares the staging area to what is in the most recent commit in the repository.

Good to use branches when doing an experiemental feature or one for a next release.

Diagrams help you see where braches split off and if any commit is unreachable
